# CASP-reminder

This is a message reminder tool for CASP( The Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction).

If you're interested in protein structure prediction ,don't need to worry missing the latest news of CASP, 

this tool can help you get the latest messages quickly and easily, with a clear show of GUI interface.

Annotation：The GUI interface is designed for 2k resolution，you may need some modification like "#QtCore.QCoreApplication.setAttribute(QtCore.Qt.AA_DisableHighDpiScaling)" to fit your system.

If you're likely to use it, plz download the code package, and just run zhe main.py, then you can get the news.

Moreover, you can make any improvement such as add directly message reminding via your server, accorind to the crawler analysis results in loda method of main.py.

It's my first practice project uploading to Github, if you have any idea or question, welcome to contact me!
